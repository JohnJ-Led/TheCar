How do I approach designing software? ***Upon hearing initial requirements, a general idea is formed on what is needed for an outcome to be achieved. From there research on these ideas is performed and then a plan formulated for next steps.***
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? ***Development of clean coding practices.***
What design process did you follow for your project work? ***Iterative design with continous refactors and undates to the code base***
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? ***Iterative design techniques are a requirement to creating successful applications that can grow with an ever changing technological environment***

How do I approach developing programs? ***The same way as I approach designing software, listen to requirements and then research.***
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? ***Creating re-usable functions***
How did iteration factor into your development? ***Every new section required the code based to be iterated over and updated to add new functionality***
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? ***Deeper research into multiple solutions and ways to integrate those solutions together. This resulted in a completed project.***

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? ***My current career goals are in the realm of full-stack development and/or that of data science. A lot of learning to work with a language can be found through web search api, but a foundation to create scalable software is not easliy learned through stackexchange.***
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? ***At this time it is unknown, other than learning how to directly interact with the GPU and it's potential to move into Machine Learning.***
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? ***Same as previous question***
